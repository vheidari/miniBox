# MiniBox 
Before anything, *MiniBox* is an experimental project for me.

*MiniBox* will prepare a `Linux kernel` to run `BusyBox` through an initrd script. It's a kind of fun project that helps people explore things and learn about the `Linux Kernel` and `BusyBox's` capabilities. At least for me, it's fun :)

If you want to learn more about it, it's enough to `clone` it and run it, or you should spend a bit of time to read the miniBox.sh script.
